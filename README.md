Report
Instructions:
  - Write a program that allows the user to enter their subjects and grades for
    the semester (4 subjects and grades). The subjects should be stored in an
    array and the marks in another array. Your program will then create a
    report using the information stored in the two arrays as follows.
    
  - Part 1: output the subject and percentage grade for each course along with
    the level that corresponds to the percentage grade
    
   ie Math: 96% (Level 4)
  - Level 4: 80-100
  - Level 3: 70-79
  - Level 2: 60-69
  - Level 1: 50-59
  - R: below 50
  
  - Part 2: output your overall average as a %
  
  - Part 3: Output an appropriate message according to the student’s average.
  
Look Fors:
  - Header (Name, date, and what the program is and/or does)
  - Code is easy to read, well formatted/indented, good use of whitespace, …
  - Comments: clearly state what you are doing and how → these are your voice explaining
    your thinking (you can’t have too many)
  - Appropriate variable naming conventions and data types including arrays
  - Decision structures
  - Loops
  - Presentation of report: make sure your report has a header/title and is laid out well
    using appropriate whitespace
